		<h1>Buffered Received Packet</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			This page represents a single packet to be received on a UDP port. A packet will have an ID, which represents the relative order in which the packet is expected to arrive in. Unlike a typical <a href="CD - Receive Packet.htm">receive packet</a>, this packet only operates on buffers of data instead of channels.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Configuration Summary</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Description/summary of the basic purpose of the controls on this screen.-->
			A receive packet must be configured with a local NIC and port to send on. Additionally, the packet needs a destination address and port to try to send to. Further configuration can adjust the endianness of the expended inbound packet contents. The size of the buffer must also be defined for this packet. The packet itself will create the buffer at run time. A pointer to the buffer is exposed via the <i>Buffer</i> channel on the first execution of the simulation. Another custom device or model that wants to read data from this buffer must have a channel mapped to the <i>Buffer</i> channel. An invalid buffer will take the value of 0 in the channel.<br><br>

Additionally, generates unique log files for the enabled packet. These log files can be found in the custom device directory on the target in the 'UDP_CD_Debug_Logs' directory. The custom device directory varies by target.  The log file creation will be displayed at startup on the console. These log files are unmanaged and should be manually cleaned-up or removed from the target upon completion of debug. Debug logs automatically begin overwriting old records after the file size has exceeded ~24MB. This caps the log file size around 24MB.<br><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Debug mode sacrifices significant performance for thorough logging of errors. This includes receive packet timeouts and other potential error conditions.</td>

						<a href="INFO - Receive Circular Buffer Format.htm">Circular Buffer Formatting</a><br>
						<STRONG>Circular Buffer:</STRONG> A received packet fills the buffer in a circular fashion, appending each received packet to the end of the previously received packet. Automatically handles roll-over events. A roll-over event will never result in a split packet, restarting at the beginning of the buffer if a packet is too large to fit into the remainder of the buffer.<br>
						<STRONG>Circular Buffer + Size:</STRONG> Each payload received has size data stored with it in the buffer. The buffer is handled similarly to the <i>Circular Buffer</i> option.<br>
						<a href="INFO - Receive Internal Cache Format.htm">Internal Cache Formatting</a><br>
						<STRONG>Internal Cache:</STRONG> Received packets are placed sequentially in an internal buffer (cache) until the buffer would be full. The contents of the cache are then copied in bulk to the shared memory accessible to the rest of the Veristand application. The cache is then cleared and inbound packets are once again placed in the cache from the beginning.<br>
						<STRONG>Internal Cache + Size:</STRONG> Functions the same as the <i>Internal Cache</i> option, but includes several additional delimiters and headers to assist with parsing and buffer traversal. Notably, each packet is stored in the cache with its size.<br>
						<a href="INFO - Receive Ping Pong Format.htm">Ping Pong Formatting</a><br>
						<STRONG>Ping Pong:</STRONG> Enables the use of a secondary buffer. Received packets are placed sequentially in an active buffer until the buffer would be full. The active buffer is then changed to the other buffer. Data in both buffers is accessible to the rest of the Veristand application. Data in the inactive buffer is cleared the moment it becomes active.<br>
						<STRONG>Ping Pong + Size:</STRONG> Functions the same as the <i>Ping Pong</i> option, but includes several additional delimiters and headers to assist with parsing and buffer traversal. Notably, each packet is stored in the buffers with its size.<br>
