		<h1>Transmit Packet</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			This page represents a single packet to be transmitted out on a UDP port. A packet will have an ID, which represents the relative order in which the packet will be sent. This is the primary means for formatting and sending channel data out on a UDP port.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Configuration Summary</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Description/summary of the basic purpose of the controls on this screen.-->
			A transmit packet must be configured with a local NIC and port to send on. Additionally, the packet needs a destination address and port to try to send to. Further configuration can adjust the endianness of the packet contents, the packet header, and frequency the packet is transacted. A packet header must have at least the <i>Packet Size</i> bytes. Channels to send in the transmit packet may be added using the <i>Add Channel(s)</i> button or right-click menu option from the system definition tree.<br><br>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Configure Header</STRONG></td>
					<td>Clicking on this button opens a dialogue that displays the current <a href="INFO - Packet Headers.htm">header payload</a> that will be used for the transmit packet. Header elements may be removed and added as needed.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Configure Threading</STRONG></td>
					<td>Clicking on this button opens a dialogue that displays the current <a href="INFO - Threading Options.htm">threading options</a> that will be used for the transmit packet. These options adjust the runtime behavior of the packet threading.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Endianness</STRONG></td>
					<td>Determines the byte endianness of the transmitted packet. Supports little-endian and big-endian.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>IP Address of Local NIC</STRONG></td>
					<td>IP address of the local network interface card to use to send this packet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>IP Address of Destination</STRONG></td>
					<td>IP address of the destination that is going to receive this packet. When the <i>Multicast?</i> option is set active, this field is used for the Multicast address.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Port</STRONG></td>
					<td>The local port to use to send this packet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Destination Port</STRONG></td>
					<td>IP address of the destination that is going to receive this packet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>TTL</STRONG></td>
					<td>Sets the Time-To-Live property for transmitted packets. This is necessary when traversing particular pieces of networking equipment.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Auto-Assign Local NIC</STRONG></td>
					<td>A shortcut functionality that enables the auto-population of the <i>IP Address of Local NIC</i> field. Attempts to use the IP address assigned to controller or realtime host.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Port as Channel</STRONG></td>
					<td>When active, creates a <i>Port</i> channel. This port channel can be modified at runtime to change the destination port a packet is being sent to.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Debug Mode</STRONG></td>
					<td>When active, logs verbose error messages to the Veristand console and default Veristand log file. Only errors are logged. Issues with opening duplex connections are current unhandled. Additionally, generates unique log files for the enabled packet. These log files can be found in the custom device directory on the target in the 'UDP_CD_Debug_Logs' directory. The custom device directory varies by target.  The log file creation will be displayed at startup on the console. These log files are unmanaged and should be manually cleaned-up or removed from the target upon completion of debug. Debug logs automatically begin overwriting old records after the file size has exceeded ~24MB. This caps the log file size around 24MB.<br><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Debug mode sacrifices significant performance for thorough logging of errors. This includes receive packet timeouts and other potential error conditions.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Transmit Options</STRONG></td>
					<td>This parameter controls the behavior of the <i>Transmit</i> channel. All transmit behavior is pending valid buffers, transmit bytes, and ports as relevant.<br><STRONG>Always:</STRONG> This packet will always attempt to be sent, regardless of the value of the <i>Transmit</i> channel.<br><STRONG>One-Shot:</STRONG> This packet will be sent any time the <i>Transmit</i> channel changes to a non-zero value. For example, this packet is transmitted when a change from 1 to 2 is observed, but not transmitted when a change from 1 to 0 is observed.<br><STRONG>Toggle:</STRONG> This packet is sent as long as the value of the <i>Transmit</i> channel is non-zero.</td>

These conditions only occur upon successful transmission of a packet.<br><STRONG>PCL Reset:</STRONG> The <i>Transmitted</i> channel will set to 1 for approximately least one PCL cycle before returning to 0.<br><STRONG>Counter:</STRONG> The <i>Transmitted</i> channel will continuously count up every time a packet is sent.<br><STRONG>Mirror:</STRONG> The <i>Transmitted</i> channel will display the same value as the <i>Transmit</i> channel.</td>

				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Tx Channels</STRONG></td>
					<td>Enumerates <STRONG>ALL THE CHANNELS</STRONG> configured to be transmitted with this transmit packet, as well as their expected data type, order in the packet, and the path to their source channel. A channel may be removed by selecting it from this list, right-clicking, and selecting <i>Remove Channels</i>. The <a href="INFO - Data Types.htm">data type</a> of a channel may be changed similarly. Channel transmit order may be changed by dragging and dropping channels in this listbox.</td>
