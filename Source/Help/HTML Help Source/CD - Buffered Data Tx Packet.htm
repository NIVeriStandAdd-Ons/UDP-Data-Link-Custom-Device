		<h1>Buffered Transmit Packet</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			This page represents a single packet to be transmitted out on a UDP port. A packet will have an ID, which represents the relative order in which the packet will be sent. Unlike a typical <a href="CD - Transmit Packet.htm">transmit packet</a>, this packet only operates on buffers of data instead of channels.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Configuration Summary</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Description/summary of the basic purpose of the controls on this screen.-->
			A transmit packet must be configured with a local NIC and port to send on. Additionally, the packet needs a destination address and port to try to send to. Further configuration can adjust the endianness of the packet contents, the packet header, and frequency the packet is transacted. The size of the buffer must also be defined for this packet. The packet itself will create the buffer at run time. A pointer to the buffer is exposed via the <i>Buffer</i> channel on the first execution of the simulation. Another custom device or model that wants to push data into this buffer must have a channel mapped to the <i>Buffer</i> channel.
